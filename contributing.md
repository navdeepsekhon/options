### Help improve OptionNotes! 

I would love for OptionNotes to turn into a community driven project. You can help by:

- Adding more information to existing strategies if you find something missing
- Adding any trading strategies that you use that are missing from the site
- Add real world trade examples to the strategies
- Add profit/loss diagrams to the strategies
- Margin requirements for different strategies
- Anything else you think an options trader might find useful, even if it is not a strategy

### There are few ways you can do this:

- Go to the [github project page](https://github.com/navdeepsekhon/options) and make the edits yourself and create a pull request. You can learn about creating a pull request here. [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
- Or you can create a new issue with the details. Create an issue [here](https://github.com/navdeepsekhon/options/issues)
- Or just reach out to me on twitter [@navdeepco](https://twitter.com/navdeepco)
