- Sell a call without owning the underlying stock
- Limited profit potential, unlimited loss potential
- If looking to profit from just a few point drop in stock, consider selling deep in the money calls. Profit will be close to 1 to 1 for drop. Profit will be similar to a short sale, except has lower margin requirements
- Far out of the money calls offer lower premium but higher probability of success
