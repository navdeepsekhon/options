- Sell an option, buy another option at same strike but with later expiry
- Idea is that time will erode value of nearer term option faster than later term

## Neutral calendar spread
- calls near the current stock price
- Plan to close near the expiration of near term option
- Best to establish with near term expiration about 8-12 weeks out because rate of delay increases substantially under 8 weeks
- If the stock falls substantially, best option might be to do nothing. Closing out the position could be expensive, closing out just the long call might leave an uncovered call

## Bullish calendar spread
- Calls above the current stock price
- Requires the stock doesn’t move above strike until the nearer expiry but moves above strike by the later expiry 
- Pick a volatile stock that has the potential to make the required move up
- Do not use options more than one strike above the current stock price
- Do not put large investment in calendar spread since it has a low probability of success
