- Short the stock, buy more calls than required to cover the short position
- Profits if stock falls or rises. Limited loss, theoretically unlimited profit potential
- Same effect can be achieved by buying a straddle i.e. a put and a call.
- Can be used if listed puts have low liquidity
- Can be effective with volatile stocks
