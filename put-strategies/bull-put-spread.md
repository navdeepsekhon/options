- Bullish strategy
- Sell 1 put, but another put with lower strike. Example, sell 50 strike put, buy 40 strike put
- Opposite of the Bear put spread
- Profit if stock stays or goes higher (You keep the initial profit received.)
- Similar to a naked put, but with limited risk because of the long put.
- Will be slower to profit than naked put since the long call will counteract the theta/delta decay
